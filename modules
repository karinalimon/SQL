CREATE TABLE modules (
name TEXT
, modules_assigned REAL
, modules_completed REAL
);

INSERT INTO modules VALUES
('Brian Hernandez',	14,	7)

-- Step 1. Let's see what this table looks like!

SELECT *
FROM modules;

--  Step 2. Let’s add a new column called "modules_remaining" which equals the modules_completed subtracted from modules_assigned. Run the following query.
SELECT name, modules_assigned - modules_completed AS modules_remaining
FROM modules;

--  Step 3. Now, let’s look at this data in a different way. Instead of asking how many modules are left, let’s find the fraction of completed modules. To do this, we’ll divide the completed modules by how many were assigned.

--  Before you run the following query, add an alias to name the new column "fraction_completed” (you won’t use the quotation marks). In other words, use AS to name the column like in Step 2. When you’re done, run the query.

SELECT name, modules_completed / modules_assigned AS fraction_completed
FROM modules;

--  Step 4. A very common calculation is converting fractions to percentages. We’ll copy our equation from before that gave us the fraction (modules_completed / modules_assigned) and multiply it by 100. 

--  Before you run this query, assign an alias that names the new column “percent”.

SELECT name, (modules_completed / modules_assigned)*100 AS percent_completed
FROM modules;

--  Now that we've seen some basic calculations, return to the lesson to learn about rounding. But don’t close this db-fiddle yet, we’ll be back for more one query!

-- Step 5. ROUND() to different places
SELECT
name
, (modules_completed / modules_assigned)*100 AS percent
, ROUND((modules_completed / modules_assigned)*100, 3) AS 'ROUND(percent ,3)'
, ROUND((modules_completed / modules_assigned)*100, 2) AS 'ROUND(percent ,2)'
, ROUND((modules_completed / modules_assigned)*100, 1) AS 'ROUND(percent ,1)'
, ROUND((modules_completed / modules_assigned)*100) AS 'ROUND(percent)'
FROM modules
;
